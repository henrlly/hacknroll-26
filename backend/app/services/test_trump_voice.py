    Dear CS2100 students, I am Aaron Tan, coordinator of CS2100. On behalf of the CS2100 team, WELCOME to CS2100!

This coming Monday, 12 January 2026, 10am to 12nn, will be our first recitation. It will be held at UTown Auditorium 2.

On Monday, I will go through some administrative and important information. This is important so please do not miss it.

In case you are late or you miss the class, all CS2100 recitations are webcast and the recordings will be uploaded onto Canvas after the class (give the IT unit a few hours to upload).

As CS2100 is on blended learning mode, you are urged to do the Canvas Quiz “00. Course Policy Quiz” which will be available on 12 January (I had wanted to release it earlier, but Canvas disallows quizzes to be released before the start of the semester.)

Every week a few new quizzes will be released, and you are to attempt them."
