    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PLAN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"\n",
    "Create a detailed plan for a 20-second Fireship-style explainer video about the following topic:\n",
    "{{ topic }}\n",
    "\n",
    "# GENERAL RULES\n",
    "- There **must** be a total of 4 scenes, each 5 seconds long, for a total video duration of 20 seconds.\n",
    "- Each scene **must** represent one cut.\n",
    "- Narration should be punchy and opinionated, similar to Fireship videos.\n",
    "- The video **must** be funny and reference popular internet culture or memes where appropriate.\n",
    "- Select a main and secondary font to use for the entire video, for cohesiveness of the video. (This will be used during editing.) The fonts should be commonly available.\n",
    "- DO NOT add any branding or mention Fireship in any way.\n",
    "- DO NOT add any generic call to action (e.g., \"like and subscribe\", \"follow for more\").\n",
    "- When executing the plan, we will have access to the manim animation tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For each scene, provide the following details\n",
    "1. Scene number (0-indexed)\n",
    "2. Rough duration of the scene (in seconds)\n",
    "3. Description of scene visuals\n",
    "4. Narration/script for the scene\n",
    "5. Description of any sound effects or background music\n",
    "6. Edit notes (e.g., transitions, effects)\n",
    "7. List of assets needed (Visual or Sound effect)\n",
    "8. Scene structure (high-level sequence of events in the scene)\n",
    "\n",
    "# RULES FOR SCENE STRUCTURE\n",
    "- Scene structure should be a numbered list of the sequence of events in the scene.\n",
    "- Only specify exact timings for when to start the scene voiceover. Each scene has a separate voiceover audio file.\n",
    "- DO NOT specify exact timings for anything else in the scene structure.\n",
    "Example scene structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Dark background initialization\n",
    "2. Start scene voiceover immediately at t=0\n",
    "3. Animate title text \"LINKED LISTS\" at the top\n",
    "4. Sequentially introduce 4 linked list nodes from left to right:\n",
    "    - Each node appears with a pop sound\n",
    "    - Each node connects to the previous node via an arrow\n",
    "5. Emphasize \"TREASURE HUNT\" with larger text and glow\n",
    "6. End with a highlight traversal from first node to last\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# RULES FOR VISUAL ASSETS\n",
    "- When executing the plan, we will use the manim tool to generate visuals besides just using assets.\n",
    "- Manim can generate animated graphs, text, shapes, and vector graphics.\n",
    "- DO NOT list assets that will be generated using manim.\n",
    "- DO NOT list manim as an asset.\n",
    "- DO list visual assets that cannot be generated using manim, such as:\n",
    "    - Meme or funny images or clips (e.g., surprised pikachu meme, distracted boyfriend meme, pepelaugh)\n",
    "    - Stock images or clips (e.g., a person typing on a laptop, city skyline timelapse)\n",
    "- Be liberal in listing visual assets that will enhance the video.\n",
    "- Visual assets should appear on screen for at least 1 second to allow viewers to absorb them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# RULES FOR ASSETS\n",
    "- Asset descriptions should specify EXACTLY what the asset is.\n",
    "    - GOOD description: \"A dog eating a hot dog alone\"\n",
    "    - BAD description: \"A dog eating something that seems tasty\". This is too vague.\n",
    "- Each asset description should only describe a SINGLE SPECIFIC asset. DO NOT give options.\n",
    "    - GOOD description: \"surprised pikachu meme\". This describes a single specific asset.\n",
    "    - BAD description: \"loss meme or struggling person image\". This has multiple options.\n",
    "- DO NOT give examples in the asset descriptions.\n",
    "    - BAD description: \"A meme expressing frustation (e.g., person facepalming, character looking defeated)\". This is an example, not a description.\n",
    "- Each asset should include BOTH a short and a long description.\n",
    "- Short description:\n",
    "    - Short descriptions will be used to look up assets from the asset database.\n",
    "    - Short description should be EXTREMELY short and generic and use less than 6 words. The asset database is limited and cannot handle very specific descriptions.\n",
    "    - DO NOT include words like \"image\", \"clip\", \"visual\", \"stock footage\", or \"sound effect\" in the short description.\n",
    "    - Examples of Short description (non-exhaustive): \"Surprised pikachu meme\", \"Explosion sound effect\"\n",
    "- Long description:\n",
    "    - Long description will be used as the prompt for the AI to generate the assets.\n",
    "    - Long description should be more DETAILED and SPECIFIC than the short description.\n",
    "    - Examples of Long description (non-exhaustive): \"A dog eating a hot dog alone\", \"Loud explosion sound effect with deep bass\"\n",
    "- We will compare the assets generated (with long description) with the assets in the asset database (with short description) and select the best asset that matches both descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# RULES FOR NARRATION/SCRIPT\n",
    "- Narration/script should be written in a conversational tone, as if explaining to a friend.\n",
    "- Enhance the narration with humor, analogies, and relatable examples where appropriate to keep the audience engaged.\n",
    "- Enhance the narration with internet culture references and memes where appropriate.\n",

    "{{ scene_structure }}\n",
    "\n",
    "# OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS\n",
    "- **Class Name:** Define the main class as `Scene{{ scene_number }}`.\n",
    "- **Format:** Output **only** the raw Python code. Do not use Markdown formatting, backticks, or code blocks.\n",
    "- **Libraries Allowed:** You have access to `manim`, `cv2`, and `numpy` only.\n",
    "\n",
    "# STYLE & ANIMATION GUIDELINES\n",
    "1.  **Fireship Style:** The scene **must** be fast-paced, engaging, funny, and high-energy.\n",
    "2.  **No Branding:** Do not mention Fireship or add any branding.\n",
    "3.  **No Call to Action:** Do not include generic calls to action (e.g., \"like and subscribe\", \"follow for more\").\n",
    "3.  **Visuals:** Use the main and secondary fonts provided in the plan. You may use other common fonts if they fit the style.\n",
    "4.  **Boundaries:** Ensure all visual elements, including animated captions, images, and text, remain strictly within the frame boundaries. No element should be clipped by the edges of the screen.\n",
    "5.  **Colors**: Do not use standard Manim color constants (e.g., RED, GREEN). You **must** strictly define color constants with this exact format: `NEW_COLOR = ManimColor.from_rgb((R, G, B), alpha=1.0)`. DO NOT define colors in any other way.\n",
    "6.  **Captions:**\n",
    "    *   Include animated captions for the voiceover.\n",
    "    *   Captions **must** be semantic phrases, not individual words. DO NOT create one caption per word.\n",
    "    *   Each caption **must** span the combined duration of its associated words.\n",
    "    *   Captions **must** appear and disappear within 0.2s of the voiceover timing\n",

    "    *   **Never** add an `ImageMobject` to a `VGroup`.\n",
    "    *   If you need to group images (or mix images with vectors/text), you **must** use `Group()` instead of `VGroup()`.\n",
    "2.  **Numpy Types in Text:** If numpy strings used, you **must** explicitly cast them to a Python string before passing to Manim objects.\n",
    "3.  **Code Blocks:** If code snippets are required, you **must** strictly instantiate the `Code` class using the following signature (filling in `code_string` and `language` as needed):\n",

    "    Code(\n",

    "        paragraph_config=None\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4.  **Minimum Wait Time:** You **must** ensure that the wait duration in `self.wait(duration)` is positive, by enforcing a minimum wait time of 0.01s for any calls with `self.wait(max(0.01, duration))`.\n",
